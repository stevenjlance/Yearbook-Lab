# React Parent-Child Lecture

![Yearbook Preview](./yearbookpreview.png)

**GOAL**: You have been tasked with creating a digital yearbook for DPCHS. The page has been given to you as one giant HTML file. Convert the page to React components and render the student data on each card.

## Today's Lab

1. With your partner, brainstorm what your parent and child components should be. Create a diagram of what the structure of the page should look like
2. The page has been given to you as one giant HTML file. Convert the page to React components. **NOTE**: You will have to create a components folder to store your newly created components. Donâ€™t forget to import and export your components.
3. Student data has been provided for you for all seniors. Pass this data to the `<SeniorCard />` that you create and render each individual student using a `map` function.
4. **STRETECH**: Create a file called `juniordata.js`.Add information about the juniors (similar to the data used for seniors) and render this information in the `<JuniorCard />` that you created!
